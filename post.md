RJ’s Deluge. Cloud is clear.

Let me take an analogy of a river, serving as a lifeline for a city.Things ran smoothly
everyday. No hassle.The world is sustaining climatic changes.Rivulets streaming to the
main river contain extraneous assets. In addition, due to heavy industrialization in certain
areas, it opens the floodgates to the main river. As a result, there is deluge in the city.A
huge volume of water inundating at high velocity brings along with it a variety of
bio-diverse things which can be an asset or toxic waste.The city has to tame this shrew.
Low-lying areas will get submerged. High-rise buildings can sustain but plying from one
part to another part will be affected and many other avenues of problems.....Can we stay
afloat? How long?Questions galore!


A stitch in time saves nine. Siphon off a part of the the first deluge to another part of the
city, thus not losing anything but reducing the velocity and Volume down stream or for
that part of the city. Waste from here can be a boon for other fields-not to worry.Let the
main deluge continue downstream and mix with other streams. Controlling at each and
every phase is necessary to mitigate uncertain asset. The other streams joining the main
river too follow the same pattern as the first deluge.Good Business Analysts fish in
troubled waters.It is good to fish in tributaries.We must learn from history, else we are
bound to repeat. Keep documenting.Taming of the shrew is not as easy as in theory.
Change of plans has to be flexible in each phase to meet the need of an hour. Divert the
flow as and when needed.Huge reservoirs must be there in each strategic location.The
name of the game is known in advance that the water level in each phase and at the end is
maintained and biodiversity is not lost at all. In order to manage deluges, various tools are
there in place.All tools, machines use in the process of managing the flood must be
eco-friendly.


The old machines, tools that have been in use are not meant to handle 
deluge.Architectural changes are implemented to meet the needs.These new tools,
machines can handle any amount of variegated things coming at high speed. They are
agnostic to any variety.Their modeling is simplified.


Now the reservoir can be contaminated. It may not be eco-friendly for all and sundry.
Some vendors of those machines or tools may have processed with acidic , basic or both
and some costly solutions.The cost of operation maybe high. The cheapest,best, safest,
purest water comes from the cloud.It can be rain-harvested.


The first few instances of rain can cause hiccups if we imbibe, since rain has to pass
through polluted Sulphuric, Nitric substances....However, subsequent ones are known to
be the best, cheapest,safest, purest.


So if the cloud is available for us, why not use it? Some vendors use Cloud environment.


Like food , Mobile and internet seem to be indispensable these days. So do business;
without streaming multimedia, it seems it may not be enterprising. So we are living in the
era of deluge.Many organizations are on the rat race to adopt these latest tools and
machines. In the process, it evokes a sense of being left alone by other organizations and
they are adopting too. There is safety in number?So these huge robust engines, tools are
meant for situations such as flood-infested areas. They are not meant for tiny rivulets.


So going back to traditional EDW/BI tools!!!does EDW have small amount of data? Is it
homogeneous, heterogeneous source? In our era of deluge is it befitting the current
requirement? Can it handle Tweet data efficiently or some streaming with variegated data
types? With the advent of various types of JSONs, xml and other group types, data
modeling, ETL processing,pre-aggregating take a meandering route to a great extent. The
world is changing so fast. DW remains DW. However tools, technology,climate,
frameworks are fast changing. Do latest frameworks with inbred rich tools seem to
overshadow DW? Or infringe into the DW-BI’s sphere.
